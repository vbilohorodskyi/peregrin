# peregrin
Peregrin is a light-weight performance tool for frontend QA to measure page load time in the right way.


====================DESCRIPTION:============================

Peregrin architecture consists of 3 files:

map.txt - file where you can specify pages to test
! ALL URLs from the new line, no EOF-EOL symbols,
! ALL URLs must be specified with excact protocol, as it is done in URL string of browser


config.py - configuration and system constants, that can be changed with simple text editors:

    MAP_FILE = 'map.txt' -- map file, 'map.txt' by default. If you want to specify some additional tests, pages can be
                            added to other file and you will need to specify it before running tests

    TRIES_COUNT = 5 -- integer number of iterations of performance measurement for each page, it's needed to make a
                        clear vision about average load time

peregrin.py -- main script to run tests.

=====================INSTALLATION:============================
